Today I m going to stream trying to create a simple website with Haskell

### What we want to achieve
- the website should render markdown files
- we will use Scotty http://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty
- ideally I would like to deploy this today but ... we'll see how it goes

### What happened 

* Cabal not up to date
* run `cabal install cabal-install`
* cabal sandbox was still not available so running again from git bash
* sandbox was just not working so I just kept going, probably means that I'm destroying this machine as a development environment but I just wanted to get started doing some stuff
* Kept going changing the cabal file as stated here http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-15-making-a-website-with-haskell.html
* ... downloads the whole internet :D My guess is that this is either the heroku tools or I did something really stupid =) and there I was...wanting to write some haskell ... 

* Just found this http://activedeveloper.info/practical-haskell-converting-markdown-to-html.html
